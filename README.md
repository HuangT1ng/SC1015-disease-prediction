# SC1015-Predicting potential Diseases using symptoms


## About

This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) by team 3 from A140 which focuses on predicting disease using machine learning. 
For detailed walkthrough, please view the source code: (https://github.com/HuangT1ng/SC1015-disease-prediction/blob/main/Disease%20Prediction.ipynb)
  
## Contributors

- Huang Ting - Neural Networks, Data Resampling, Naive bayes
- Gupta - Logistic Regression, Data Visualization, Data Extraction

## Problem Definition

- How to keep track of personal health status conveniently and affordably?
- Which machine learning model would be the best to realise our goal?

## Data Set
- Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning by kaushil268 from kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaushil268/disease-prediction-using-machine-learning)

## Models Used

1. Logistic Regression
2. Neural Networks
3. naive bayes

## Conclusion

- our models perform really well in predicting test sets with an accuracy of up to 99%
- however the prediction is to be taken with a pinch of salt as the data set firstly does not contain all symptoms and diseases in the world and the size of data set is rather small also it does not contain other important predictors such as medical history age etc
- the model can be deployed onto an web page or application where by its easy for user to access it this tackles the issue of convenience
- the model will be free for everyone to use thus making it affordable
- it can also be used by healthcare professionals and hospitals which can train the model using their own patient data and aid healthcare workers in the diagnosis of their patients
- that being said we believe that our model solves the problem of helping individuals to track their health statue conveniently and affordably

## What did we learn from this project?

- Tensorflow, Basic Neural Networks, Keras
- Logistic Regression from sklearn
- naive bayes model
- coding a dropdown menu in jupyternotebook (literally took me a day)
- Collaborating using GitHub
- Concepts about Precision, Recall, and F1 Score while we explore methods to verify our test result
